"Alb" - very simple photo gallery written in PHP

HOWTO
=====

- uploading photos is done via FTP (most probably there won't be other way for uploading)
- simply place your folders/albums with photos into 'photos/' folder (default). That should be all.

Details/Features
================

- read and customize config.php
- the look of your gallery can be customized, see config.php where you can change the template and/or css used
- no DBs are used and won't be in the future versions
- photos are resized on server to fit user's browser window
- resized versions are cached. Please set 777 permisions to 'cache/' folder (default)
- uses a slightly modified slimbox2 to display photos


TODO
====

- clean up cache based on files access. 
  - trigger this action when first photo is displayed. Most probably user is looking at an album and will stay on current page.
- show more info from EXIF
- create textfile per album where one can customize album a bit or set some values:
  - (re)name is photo/album
  - setup maximum size for display (S M L XL X2 X3)
