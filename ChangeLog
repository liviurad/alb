v0.9 - switch to ImageMagick
- resize is now done with imagemagick (seems to be more reliable than GD)
- border added (not customizable yet)
- other small visual changes

v0.8 - Initial version
DONE:
- uploading photos is done via FTP (most probably there won't be other way for uploading)
- simply place your folders/albums with photos into 'photos/' folder (default). That should be all.
- read and customize config.php
- the look of your gallery can be customized, see config.php where you can change the template and/or css used
- no DBs are used and won't be in the future versions
- photos are resized on server to fit user's browser window
- resized versions are cached. Please set 777 permisions to 'cache/' folder (default)
- uses a slightly modified slimbox2 to display photos
TODO:
- clean up cache based on files access.
